            I had the best food by far in Barcelona. I loved trying all the new foods like proscuito, churros, and lots of cheese.
            We walked across the beach, but it was too cold to sit in the sand or go in the water. The weather wasn't my favorite but
            we went during the wintertime. In the summer, the beaches are probably even more packed. A lot of people seemed to be riding bikes or mopeds!

            My mom and I did a lot of shopping while my brother and dad tried even more food. The time difference made it hard to sleep 
            and wake up early the next morning. After the trip I decided cheese was definitely my new favorite food. The gelato was also delicious and
            there were a plethora of flavors.
