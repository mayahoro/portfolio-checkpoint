            I traveled to Cancun with my family (my brother, mom, and dad). We had a relaxing vacation at the hotel right on the beach. We went 
            on this trip right before covid started. It was one of the last times where life felt normal. The ocean was bright blue and the weather was 
            perfect, barely any clouds in the sky during the day.

            One night we went out to nice restaurant to celebrate my moms birthday. As we were walking back to the hotel my little brother decided to chase me around the streets.
            I slipped in the middle of the road and twisted my ankle. I cried the whole walk back but I knew I would have the rest of the week to relax and sit in the sun anyway. 
            The next morning I woke up and had a delicious breakfast with fresh fruit but I was still unable to walk. It was nice to recover by the beach for the rest of the trip!
