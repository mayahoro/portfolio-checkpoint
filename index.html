    <p> Hello!! I am Maya. Welcome to my page of travels. Here you will see places I have traveled to in the past couple years. I hope I can go to more exotic
        places in the future and maybe live somewhere one day! I have been to Costa Rica, Barcelona, and Cancun before the pandemic. I am 
        excited to travel even more!!
    </p>
    <p>All of the photos pictured are from my camera roll. I love photographing the new foods I have tried as well as the beautiful landscapes.
        While a picture doesn't truly grasp the quality of the moment, it helps remember! I hope you enjoy!
